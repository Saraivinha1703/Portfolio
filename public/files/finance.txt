Investing is all about making your savings multiply. Before we dive into all the details of how to do that, here are a few investing basics for beginners:

How much money you need to start investing: Not a lot. In fact, it’s mathematically proven that it’s better to start small than to wait until you have more to deploy — even if you try to play catch-up down the road. That little eye-opener is thanks to a magic formula called compound interest. (We’ll get into how that works in a minute and — yep — we’ve got a calculator for it.)

What to invest in: Stocks are one option. You can also consider investment vehicles that provide exposure to the stock market. The stock market is the place that will deliver the best long-term return on your money.

How to buy stocks: The easiest way to start investing in stocks, and the most common, is to buy a mutual fund — a type of investment that pools money from many investors and invests it in a group of different stocks; call it the “eggs in many baskets” approach.

The secret to making money in stocks: Stay invested. Time (to let your investments ride out the market’s inevitable short-term rough patches) and temperament (the ability to keep cool while others are freaking out) are the keys to investment success. So says a guy you might have heard of named Warren Buffett.

Saving vs. investing
There’s saving (amassing money) and then there’s investing (making it multiply). Two big differences between them: time and the type of account you use as a holding pen for your money.

Saving is what you do with the money you’re going to use to pay for short-term goals — ones in the next five years or so. That money belongs in an account where it’s liquid — that is, easily accessible — and safe, such as a high-yield savings account or even a CD if you’re confident you won’t need the funds until after a certain date.

Investing is what you do with money earmarked for long-term goals such as retirement. With a long time horizon, you can make growth, rather than liquidity, the priority.

What’s wrong with simply playing it safe with all your retirement money and keeping it in cash? Inflation! Dun dun duuunnnn.

Over time, inflation erodes the purchasing power of cash. That effect is especially strong when inflation is high, but it's also true during typical years when inflation is running 2% or 3%. At just 3% inflation, when you go to spend a $100 bill you stashed in a coffee can last year, that money will only get you $97 worth of groceries compared with what it would have gotten you last year. In other words, the cash you’ve been sitting on doesn’t buy as much as it used to, because everything has gotten 3% more expensive. That’s how it’s possible to save money and lose money — that is, spending power — at the same time.

Now imagine the effect of decades of inflation on wads of money.

Should you invest in the stock market?
One look at the historic rate of return of the major asset classes shows that the stock market is going to give you the biggest bang for your bucks. Historically, the stock market's average annual return is 10% before inflation; other asset classes rarely come close to that. 

But many people say they think it’s too risky or they don’t know how to invest money. While this is a valid concern, and investing does carry the risk of loss, having a diverse portfolio can better equip you to weather market ups and downs, and ultimately achieve your goals.

Your dollars could become more valuable
If you start investing now, you can let your savings dollars hitch a ride in a vehicle you can hold on to for years and have it possibly become more valuable than when you started.

It’s like reverse inflation: The hamburger you could buy for $1 when you were a kid would cost you $5 decades later. But you can’t store the $1 burger away for years and sell when it’s worth $5. Instead, you can buy shares in a bunch of companies involved in making that burger — the bun and beef manufacturers, packaging producers, retailers and restaurants (we’ll show you how in a moment) — and reap the rewards of their growth right alongside them.

The benefits of compound interest
What is compound interest? It's like a runaway snowball of money growing larger and larger as it rolls along. All you need to get it going is starter money.

As interest starts to accumulate on your initial investment, it is added to your ball of cash. You continue to earn interest, your balance expands in value and picks up speed — and on and on it goes.

The sooner you get the snowball rolling, the bigger it has the potential to get. Now, let’s go over how to make your pennies multiply.

4 ways to start investing
If you own a mutual fund (in your 401(k), for example) then — congratulations! — you already own stocks. A lot of people don’t realize that.

But that’s just one of the ways investors can get in on the greatest wealth-building machine on the planet. The four most common entry points into the stock market are:

1. Individual stocks
We won’t sugarcoat it: Buying individual stocks requires a fair amount of research, ongoing diligence and a stomach for risk. Those aren’t things that most retirement savers want to deal with. In fact, many 401(k) plans don’t even allow participants to buy individual stocks within the plan. If buying stocks sounds exciting to you, you might consider devoting no more than 10% of your retirement portfolio’s overall value to them to limit risk. 

2. Mutual funds
A mutual fund is a basket that contains a bunch of different investments — often mostly stocks — that all have something in common, be it companies that together make up a market index (see the box for more about the joys of index funds), a particular asset class (bonds, international stocks) or a specific sector (companies in the energy industry, technology stocks). There are even mutual funds that invest solely in companies that adhere to certain ethical or environmental principles (aka socially responsible funds).

What’s nice about mutual funds is that in a single transaction, investors are able to purchase a neatly packaged collection of investments. It’s instant, easy diversification (exposure to lots of different companies) that lets you avoid buying stocks one by one.

3. Index funds
Of all the types of mutual funds investors can purchase, we’re partial to a particular type: index funds.

Why? Because index funds generally charge lower fees, called expense ratios, than traditional mutual funds. And that lower cost is a big-time boost to your overall returns.

An index fund’s sole investment objective is to mirror the performance of a market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite.

These funds are made up entirely of the stocks contained in a particular index. (The S&P 500 index contains shares of aboout 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies, while the Nasdaq tracks thousands of stocks traded on a different exchange.) So the returns of these index funds mirror that of the market they track.

The investment objective of actively managed mutual funds, on the other hand, is to “beat the market’s returns” (translation: to outperform a benchmark index). To do that they employ managers to pick and choose the investments in a fund.

The cost of that management, along with expenses for trades, administration, marketing materials, etc., comes out of your investment returns. Largely because of that, the majority of actively managed mutual funds actually underperform their benchmark index.

Index funds are essentially run by robots. (Okay, not literal robots, but computer algorithms programmed to automatically track the market’s comings and goings.) Computer robots don’t demand Wall Street-sized year-end bonuses or need corner offices, which makes them a lot cheaper.

Those savings are passed along to you. In fact, investors pay nearly nine times more in fees for actively managed mutual funds. Choose an index fund, and more of your money stays in your portfolio to grow over time.

4. Exchange-traded funds
Like index funds, ETFs contain a bundle of investments that can range from stocks to bonds to currencies and cash. The beauty of an ETF is that it trades like a stock, which means investors can purchase them for a share price that is often less than the $500-plus minimum investment many mutual funds require.

So which of these should you use to build your retirement portfolio? The answer will be clearer after you learn how to choose investments.

Stocks represent shares of ownership in a company, and are listed for sale on a specific exchange. Exchanges track the supply and demand — and directly related, the price — of each stock. They also bring buyers and sellers together and act as a market for the shares of those companies. The stock market is made up of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. 

When you go to "invest in the stock market," you're not purchasing a piece of the stock market itself; you're purchasing stocks that are listed on those exchanges that make up the stock market.

Individual traders are typically represented by brokers — these days, that’s often an online broker. You place your stock trades through the broker, which then deals with the exchange on your behalf.

The NYSE and the Nasdaq are open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern. If those hours don't work for you, some brokers do offer premarket and after-hours trading sessions.

When you get started, stock trading information can sound like gibberish. But if you’re investing long term — with, say, a 401(k) or IRA geared toward retirement — you can get by just fine without understanding the stock market much at all, as long as you figure out how much you need to invest for retirement.

If, on the other hand, you want to learn how to trade stocks, you do need to understand the stock market, and at least some basic information about how stock trading works.

Understanding the stock market
When people refer to the stock market being up or down, they’re generally referring to one of the major market indexes.

A market index tracks the performance of a group of stocks, which either represents the market as a whole or a specific sector of the market, like technology or retail companies. You’re likely to hear most about the S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; they are often used as proxies for the performance of the overall market. On Jan. 22, 2024, for instance, the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq rose to new record highs. 

Investors use indexes to benchmark the performance of their own portfolios and, in some cases, to inform their stock trading decisions. You can also invest in an entire index through an index fund or exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which usually tracks a specific index or sector of the market.

Stock trading information
Most investors would be well-advised to build a diversified portfolio of stocks or stock index funds and hold onto it through good times and bad.

But investors who like a little more action engage in stock trading. Stock trading involves buying and selling stocks frequently in an attempt to time the market.

The goal of stock traders is to capitalize on short-term market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks at a low. Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout the day. Others are simply active traders, placing a dozen or more trades per month. (Interested in individual stocks? View our list of the best-performing stocks this year.)

Investors who trade stocks do extensive research, often devoting hours a day to following the market. They rely on technical stock analysis, using tools to chart a stock's movements in an attempt to find trading opportunities and trends. Many online brokers offer stock trading information, including analyst reports, stock research and charting tools. (Learn the basics of how to read stock charts.)

Bull markets vs. bear markets
Neither is an animal you’d want to run into on a hike, but the market has picked the bear as the true symbol of fear: A bear market means stock prices are falling — thresholds vary, but generally to the tune of 20% or more — across several of the indexes referenced earlier.

Bull markets are followed by bear markets, and vice versa, with both often signaling the start of larger economic patterns. In other words, a bull market typically means investors are confident, which indicates economic growth. A bear market shows investors are pulling back, indicating the economy may do so as well.

The good news is that the average bull market far outlasts the average bear market, which is why over the long term you can grow your money by investing in stocks.

The S&P 500, which holds about 500 of the largest stocks in the U.S., entered bull market territory in October 2022 following a bear market that started in June of that year. The index saw a massive recovery in 2023 and hit a fresh all-time high in Jan. 2024.

But the index has historically returned an average of about 7% annually, when you factor in reinvested dividends and adjust for inflation. That means if you invested $1,000 30 years ago, you could have about $7,600 today.

Stock market crash vs. correction
A stock market correction happens when the stock market drops by 10% or more. A stock market crash is a sudden, very sharp drop in stock prices, like in early 2020, around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While crashes can herald a bear market, remember what we mentioned above: Most bull markets last longer than bear markets — which means stock markets tend to rise in value over time. In 2020, the market was back to hitting record highs by August.

If you're worried about a crash, it helps to focus on the long term. When the stock market declines, it can be difficult to watch your portfolio’s value shrink in real time and do nothing about it. However, if you’re investing for the long term, doing nothing is often the best course.

Why? Because when you sell investments in a downturn, you lock in your losses. If you plan to re-enter the market at a sunnier time, you’ll almost certainly pay more for the privilege and sacrifice part (if not all) of the gains from the rebound.

The importance of diversification
You can’t avoid bear markets as an investor. What you can avoid is the risk that comes from an undiversified portfolio.

Diversification helps protect your portfolio from inevitable market setbacks. If you throw all of your money into one company, you’re banking on success that can quickly be halted by regulatory issues, poor leadership or an E. coli outbreak.

To smooth out that company-specific risk, investors diversify by pooling multiple types of stocks together, balancing out the inevitable losers and eliminating the risk that one company’s contaminated beef will wipe out your entire portfolio.

But building a diversified portfolio of individual stocks takes a lot of time, patience and research. The alternative is a mutual fund, the aforementioned exchange-traded fund or an index fund. These hold a basket of investments, so you’re automatically diversified. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, would aim to mirror the performance of the S&P 500 by investing in the 500 companies in that index.

The good news is you can combine individual stocks and funds in a single portfolio. One suggestion: Dedicate 10% or less of your portfolio to selecting a few stocks you believe in, and put the rest into index funds.

What is the stock market?
Stocks, which are also called equities, are securities that give shareholders an ownership interest in a public company. It’s a real stake in the business, and if you own a majority of the shares of the business, you control how the business operates. The stock market refers to the collection of stocks that can be bought and sold by the general public on a variety of different exchanges.

Where does stock come from? Public companies issue stock so that they can fund their businesses. Investors who think the business will prosper in the future buy those stock issues. The shareholders get any dividends plus any appreciation in the price of the shares. They can also watch their investment shrink or disappear entirely if the company runs out of money.

The stock market is really a kind of aftermarket, where people who own shares in the company can sell them to investors who want to buy them. This trading takes place on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. In years past, traders used to go to a physical location — the exchange’s floor — to trade, but now virtually all trading takes place electronically.

When news people say, “the market was up today,” typically they are referring to the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P 500 is made up of around 500 large publicly traded companies in the U.S, while the Dow includes 30 large companies. These track the performance of the collections of stock and show how they fared on that day of trading and over time.

However, even though people are referring to the Dow and the S&P 500 as “the market,” those are really indexes of stocks. These indexes represent some of the largest companies in the U.S., but they are not the total market, which includes thousands of publicly traded companies.

Of course, you’ll need a brokerage account before you start investing in stocks. As you’re getting started, here are eight more guidelines for investing in the stock market.

1. Buy the right investment
Buying the right stock is so much easier said than done. Anyone can see a stock that’s performed well in the past, but anticipating the performance of a stock in the future is much more difficult. If you want to succeed by investing in individual stocks, you have to be prepared to do a lot of work to analyze a company and manage the investment.

“When you start looking at statistics you’ve got to remember that the professionals are looking at each and every one of those companies with much more rigor than you can probably do as an individual, so it’s a very difficult game for the individual to win over time,” says Dan Keady, CFP, chief financial planning strategist at TIAA.

If you’re analyzing a company, you’ll want to look at a company’s fundamentals – earnings per share (EPS) or a price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), for example. But you’ll have to do so much more: analyze the company’s management team, evaluate its competitive advantages, study its financials, including its balance sheet and income statement. And these items are just the start.

Keady says going out and buying stock in your favorite product or company isn’t the right way to go about investing. Also, don’t put too much faith in past performance because it’s no guarantee of the future.

You’ll have to study the company and anticipate what’s coming next, a tough job in good times.

2. Avoid individual stocks if you’re a beginner
Everyone has heard someone talk about a big stock win or a great stock pick.

“What they forget about is that often they’re not talking about those particular investments that they also own that did very, very poorly over time,” Keady says. “So sometimes people have an unrealistic expectation about the kind of returns that they can make in the stock market. And sometimes they confuse luck with skill. You can get lucky sometimes picking an individual stock. It’s hard to be lucky over time and avoid those big downturns also.”

Remember, to make money consistently in individual stocks, you need to know something that the forward-looking market isn’t already pricing into the stock price. Keep in mind that for every seller in the market, there’s a buyer for those same shares who’s equally sure they will profit.

“There are tons of smart people doing this for a living, and if you’re a novice, the likelihood of you outperforming that is not very good,” says Tony Madsen, CFP, founder of NewLeaf Financial Guidance in Redwood Falls, Minnesota.

An alternative to individual stocks is an index fund, which can be either a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds hold dozens or even hundreds of stocks. And each share you purchase of a fund owns all the companies included in the index.

Unlike stock, mutual funds and ETFs may have annual fees, though some funds are free.

3. Create a diversified portfolio
One of the key advantages of an index fund is that you immediately have a range of stocks in the fund. For example, if you own a broadly diversified fund based on the S&P 500, you’ll own stocks in hundreds of companies across many different industries. But you could also buy a narrowly diversified fund focused on one or two industries.

Diversification is important because it reduces the risk of any one stock in the portfolio hurting the overall performance very much, and that actually improves your overall returns. In contrast, if you’re buying only one individual stock, you really do have all your eggs in one basket.

The easiest way to create a broad portfolio is by buying an ETF or a mutual fund. The products have diversification built into them, and you don’t have to do any analysis of the companies held in the index fund.

“It may not be the most exciting, but it’s a great way to start,” Keady says. “And again, it gets you out of thinking that you’re gonna be so smart, that you’re going to be able to pick the stocks that are going to go up, won’t go down and know when to get in and out of them.”

When it comes to diversification, that doesn’t just mean many different stocks. It also means investments that are spread among different industries – since stock in similar sectors may move in a similar direction for the same reason.

4. Be prepared for a downturn
The hardest issue for most investors is stomaching a loss in their investments. And because the stock market can fluctuate, you will have losses occur from time to time. You’ll have to steel yourself to handle these losses, or you’ll be apt to buy high and sell low during a panic.

As long as you diversify your portfolio, any single stock that you own shouldn’t have too much of an impact on your overall return. If it does, buying individual stocks might not be the right choice for you. Even index funds will fluctuate, so you can’t get rid of all of your risk, try how you might.

“Anytime the market changes we have this propensity to try to pull back or to second guess our willingness to be in,” says NewLeaf’s Madsen.

That’s why it’s important to prepare yourself for downturns that could come out of nowhere, as one did in 2020. You need to ride out short-term volatility to get attractive long-term returns.

In investing, you need to know that it’s possible to lose money, since stocks don’t have principal guarantees. If you’re looking for a guaranteed return, perhaps a high-yield CD might be better.

The concept of market volatility can be difficult for new and even experienced investors to understand, cautions Keady.

“One of the interesting things is people will see the market’s volatile because the market’s going down,” Keady says. “Of course, when it’s going up it’s also volatile – at least from a statistical standpoint – it’s moving all over the place. So it’s important for people to say that the volatility that they’re seeing on the upside, they’ll also see on the downside.”

5. Try a stock market simulator before investing real money
One way to enter the world of investing without taking risk is to use a stock simulator. Using an online trading account with virtual dollars won’t put your real money at risk. You’ll also be able to determine how you would react if this really were your money that you gained or lost.

“That can be really helpful because it can help people overcome the belief that they’re smarter than the market, that they can always pick the best stocks, always buy and sell in the market at the right time,” Keady says.

Asking yourself why you’re investing can help determine if investing in stocks is for you.

“If their thought is that they’re going to somehow outperform the market, pick all the best stocks, maybe it’s a good idea to try some type of simulator or watch some stocks and see if you could actually do it,” Keady says. “Then if you’re more serious about investing over time, then I think you’re much better off – almost all of us, including myself – to have a diversified portfolio such as provided by mutual funds or exchange traded funds.”

(Bankrate reviewed some of the best investing apps, including a few fun stock simulators.)

6. Stay committed to your long-term portfolio
Keady says investing should be a long-term activity. He also says you should divorce yourself from the daily news cycle.

By skipping the daily financial news, you’ll be able to develop patience, which you’ll need if you want to stay in the investing game for the long term. It’s also useful to minimize how often you look at your portfolio , so that you don’t become too unnerved or too excited. These are great tips for beginners who have yet to manage their emotions when investing.

“Some of the news cycle, at times it becomes 100 percent negative and it can become overwhelming for people,” Keady says.

One strategy for beginners is to set up a calendar and predetermine when you’ll be evaluating your portfolio. Sticking to this guideline will prevent you from selling out of a stock during some volatility – or not getting the full benefit of a well-performing investment, Keady says.


7. Start now
Choosing the perfect opportunity to jump in and invest in the stock market typically doesn’t work well. Nobody knows with 100 percent certainty the best time to get in. And investing is meant to be a long-term activity. There is no perfect time to start.

“One of the core points with investing is not just to think about it, but to get started,” Keady says. “And start now. Because if you invest now, and often over time, that compounding is the thing that can really drive your results. If you want to invest, it’s very important to actually get started and have … an ongoing savings program, so that we can reach our goals over time.”

8. Avoid short-term trading
Understanding whether you’re investing for the long-term future or the short term can also help determine your strategy – and whether you should be investing at all. Sometimes short-term investors can have unrealistic expectations about growing their money. And research shows that most short-term investors, such as day traders, lose money. You’re competing against high-powered investors and well-programmed computers that may better understand the market.

New investors need to be aware that buying and selling stocks frequently can get expensive. It can create taxes and other fees, even if a broker’s headline trading commission is zero.

If you’re investing for the short term, you risk not having your money when you need it.

“When I’m advising clients … anything under a couple of years, even sometimes three years out, I’m hesitant to take too much market risk with those dollars,” Madsen says.

Depending on your financial goals, a savings account, money market account or a short-term CD may be better options. Experts often advise investors that they should invest in the stock market only if they can keep the money invested for at least three to five years. Money that you need for a specific purpose in the next couple years should probably be invested in low-risk investments, such as a high-yield savings account or a high-yield CD.

9. Keep investing over time
It can be easy to dump your money into the market and think you’re done. But those who build real wealth do so over time, by adding money to their investments. That means having a strong saving discipline – holding back some of your paycheck – so that you can put it to work in the stock market. You’ll be able to put more money to work and grow your wealth even faster.

You may already be doing this if you have a 401(k) retirement account, which takes money from your biweekly pay and puts it into the investments you’ve selected. Even if you don’t have a 401(k), many brokerage accounts allow you to set up automatic transfers to your account. Then you may be able to set up automatic investments at a broker or one of the best robo-advisors.

You can automate the process of investing, helping to keep your emotions out of the process.

How the stock market works for beginners
The stock market is really a way for investors or brokers to exchange stocks for money, or vice versa. Anyone who wants to buy stock can go there and buy whatever is on offer from those who own the stock. Buyers are expecting their stocks to rise, while sellers may be expecting their stocks to fall or at least not rise much more.

So the stock market allows investors to wager on the future of a company. Together, investors set the value of the company by what price they’re willing to buy and sell at.

While stock prices in the market on any day may fluctuate according to how many shares are demanded or supplied, over time the market evaluates a company on its business results and future prospects. A business growing sales and profits will likely see its stock rise, while a shrinking business will probably see its stock fall, at least over time. In the short term, however, the performance of a stock has a lot to do with just the supply and demand in the market.

When private firms see which stocks investors favor, they may decide to fund their business by selling stock and raising cash. They’ll conduct an initial public offering, or IPO, using an investment bank, which sells shares to investors. Then investors can sell their stock later in the stock market if they want to or they can buy even more at any time the stock is publicly traded.

The key point is this: investors price stocks according to their expectations of how the company’s business will perform in the future. So the market is forward-looking, with some experts saying the market anticipates events about six to nine months away.

Risks and benefits of investing in stocks
The stock market allows individual investors to own stakes in some of the world’s best companies, and that can be tremendously lucrative. In aggregate, stocks are a good long-term investment as long as they’re purchased at reasonable prices. For example, over time the S&P 500 has generated about a 10 percent annual return, including a nice cash dividend, too.

Investing in stocks also offers another nice tax advantage for long-term investors. As long as you don’t sell your stock, you won’t owe any tax on the gains. Only money that you receive, such as dividends, will be taxable. So you can hold your stock forever and never have to pay taxes on your gains.

However, if you do realize a gain by selling the stock, you’ll owe capital gains taxes on it. How long you hold the stock will determine how it’s taxed. If you buy and sell the asset within a year, it will fall under short-term capital gains and will be taxed at your regular income tax rate. If you sell after you’ve held the asset a year, then you’ll pay the long-term capital gains rate, which is usually lower. If you record a loss, you can write that off your taxes or against your gains.

While the market as a whole has performed well, many stocks in the market don’t perform well and may even go bankrupt. These stocks are eventually worth zero, and they’re a total loss. On the other hand, some stocks such as Amazon and Apple have continued to soar for years, earning investors hundreds of times their initial investment.

So investors have two big ways to win in the stock market:

Buy a stock fund based on an index, such as the S&P 500, and hold it to capture the index’s long-term return. However, its return can vary markedly, from down 30 percent in one year to up 30 percent in another. By buying an index fund, you’ll get the weighted average performance of the stocks in the index.
Buy individual stocks and try to find the stocks that will outperform the average. However, this approach takes a lot of skill and knowledge, and it’s more risky than simply buying an index fund. However, if you can find an Apple or Amazon on the way up, your returns are likely going to be much higher than in an index fund.
Bottom line
Investing in the stock market can be very rewarding, especially if you avoid some of the pitfalls that most new investors experience when starting out. Beginners should find an investing plan that works for them and stick to it through the good times and bad.

Dividend investing is a popular strategy for generating passive income and growing your wealth over time. But to maximize the potential returns from your dividend investments, it's important to understand the key dates in the dividend process. In this article, we'll explain the different dates you need to know about, and how they can impact your dividend income. We'll also provide some tips on how to track these dates and manage your investments accordingly. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced dividend investor, this article will provide valuable information to help you get the most out of your dividend investments.

Big ideas
There are 4 main dates to know about, but the most important are the ex-dividend date, which is the last day to qualify for the dividend and the payment date, when the money is paid out to you.
The dividend yield tells you what you can expect to earn per share, and the payout ratio indicates how sustainable those earnings might be.

How do stock dividends work?
Dividends are cash payments that a company will pay to its shareholders at regular intervals (usually quarterly). They are paid out of the company's earnings.

Dividends help companies attract investors and provide you, as an investor, with regular income. Reinvesting the payment received even allows you to purchase more stock in companies that you own for free!

The dates
Companies pay dividends regularly, most often quarterly, alongside earnings reports. Here are four important dates you should add to your calendar.

1. Declaration date

The declaration date is when the company announces it is paying its dividend to investors.

On the declaration date, a declaration statement is released which includes the size of the dividend payment. It’s on this date that you learn how much you get paid!

NOTE
The declaration date can be an important day for the share price because the size of the dividend is one way management expresses its confidence (or lack thereof) in the company's future performance.
If the company increases the size of its dividend, then that shows management is confident enough in future earnings growth to give more of it away to shareholders. If a firm cuts its dividend, it's often a bad omen. That doesn’t have to be the case, so you need to look at each situation on its own merit.

Some other things to be found in the declaration statement are:
The record date
The payment date

2. Ex-dividend date

The ex-dividend date is the date by which you must own the stock to receive the next scheduled payment. In the City of London, you’ll hear about share prices falling because they went ‘Ex-Div.’

If you purchased a stock before the ex-dividend date, you are entitled to the next payment. Likewise, if you bought the stock on or after the ex-dividend date you are NOT eligible for this payment and the seller will keep it.

That’s why the share price drops when it goes Ex-Div. The price is adjusting for the fact that the shares no longer include an entitlement to receive the coming dividend payment.

3. Record date

The record date (aka. date of record) is similar to the ex-dividend date. You must be on the company's books as a shareholder (i.e. there is a record of you owning the stock) by this date, in order to receive the dividend payment.
This is the date that the company will pay the dividend to its shareholders. The company will send you the money, and if you own the stock via Trading 212, there will be a popup in the app to show you received it, normally a day or two later.
Dividend investing formulas
Next are the important ratios to know when analysing which dividend stock to buy.

1. Dividend yield

The dividend yield of a stock is a company's total payments to shareholders for the year expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
Dividend Yield = (Total Dividend / Stock Price) x 100
Using this formula, you can work out the dividend yield of a stock.

If company A trades at $120 and its dividend per share is $6 annually, to work out the dividend yield, the dividend yield calculation is as follows:
6 / 120 = 0.05
0.05 x 100 = 5
Dividend Yield = 5%
Dividend yields will change over time. If the company decides to increase its dividend, then the yield goes up, and vice versa. The dividend yield also moves with the share price. When the price of the stock drops, then the dividend yield goes up. Let’s go back to the same example to demonstrate.

Company A’s shares are now trading at $100 instead of $120, but the payout is unchanged at $6.
6 / 100 = 0.06
0.06 x 100 = 6
Dividend yield = 6%
With the same payout in dollars ($6), company A has a dividend yield of 6% when the share price is $100, which is more than the dividend yield of 5% when the share price is $120.

The benefit of a high dividend yield is obvious, it means you are getting paid more per stock that you own. But there can be some drawbacks.

If a company has a high dividend yield, it means it is choosing to give away its earnings to shareholders instead of investing them in R&D or expansion. Over time this will limit the company’s growth potential.

There is also another big caveat to a high dividend yield, it may not be sustainable. You don’t want to buy a stock for its great yield, only for management to cut the dividend to something more affordable.

2. Dividend payment ratio

Another way to think of a dividend is as a cost to the company offering it. If a company starts earning less income, the prudent thing for management to do is cut costs, one of which is the dividend. The problem is that management won’t always do the prudent thing right away.

This is where the dividend payment ratio (DPR) comes in. The DPR is the percentage of a company's earnings that it pays out to shareholders in dividends. Working out the DPR of a company allows you to see how sustainable the dividend payments are.
Payout Ratio = dividends per share (DPS) / earnings per share (EPS)
EXAMPLE
If company B has a DPS of $4 and an EPS of $2 then their payout ratio would be 50%.
Investors prefer lower DPRs because it means there is a lower risk that the dividend eventually gets cut and a better chance that it will consistently grow over time. In other words, the higher the payout ratio the less of a safety net there is for a company's earnings. One bad quarter could jeopardise the dividend.

Rule of thumb - invest when the payout ratio is below 50%. This shows that the company is reinvesting more of its profits than it is paying out, laying the groundwork for future earnings growth and dividend growth.
Example dividend stock investment
Here is an example of what happens when you own shares of Apple with Trading 212.

Before you invest, you want to see what the dividend yield is. This can be seen under the description of the company in the Trading 212 app.

Once you own shares of Apple and receive a dividend payout, the app confirmation will include the ‘date received’ and the Ex-div date, typically a week before the payment date.

Recap
The main dates to know are the declaration date, ex-div date, payment date, and record date. The declaration date is when the company announces the dividend, the ex-div date is when the stock goes ex-dividend, and the payment date is when the payment is made.

The dividend yield is a key metric for investors, as it indicates how much income they can expect to receive from their investment. The payout ratio is also important, as it tells investors how much of a company's earnings are being paid out in dividends.

You’ve got to start your dividend investing career somewhere. An attainable starting point for many new investors is one thousand dollars.

$1000 is a nice round number. If you’re from the UK then £1000 also works. It should be enough money to start a portfolio but a smaller amount than you one day hope to have invested.

Investing with small amounts presents some challenges, which we aim to help you overcome.

Big ideas
Before you even think about which stocks to add to your portfolio, you have to think about your goals. One important consideration is income vs wealth-building.
Investing in fractional shares gives you access to high-priced stocks in a small portfolio because it allows you to buy less than one share of a company.
Diversification can be achieved by selecting stocks from each of the 11 major sectors as well as by using ETFs.
What is a dividend portfolio?
A dividend portfolio is a collection of dividend-paying stocks that altogether aim to be well-diversified and give you the best chance of earning a consistent income. It’s fine to own stocks for other reasons but they just won’t be involved when making a dividend portfolio.

How to start a dividend portfolio
Having such a portfolio allows you to earn some passive income and generate wealth for the long term. You can adjust your dividend portfolio strategy to suit your own purposes.

Do you want a regular monthly income? You can do that by owning a portfolio of stocks that have payment dates every month.

For example, with 12 stocks in your portfolio, you can make sure each stock pays its dividend in a different month. With 52 stocks in the portfolio, you can get paid weekly.

You can build a diversified portfolio effortlessly when trading in the UK and Europe with Pies, and automate your investments with Autoinvest. You can also enjoy the peace of mind that comes with 24/7 support, ensuring you receive assistance whenever you need it.

You can take this a step further by changing the weighting of each stock within your portfolio to make sure your monthly payouts are the same.

EXAMPLE
Say you invest in 3 stocks:

- Stock A pays a dividend of $20 in February
- Stock B pays $30 in March
- Stock C pays $40 in April

To even out the monthly income, you can buy more of stock A and less of stock C.
Instead of using the cash for income, you can reinvest to increase the value of your portfolio and grow your wealth over time. When focusing on long-term growth, you can attach more importance to the size of payments. When focusing on income, you can focus more on the timing of the payments.
How to build a good dividend portfolio with $1000
One of the first questions on your mind is likely: How many stocks should I have in my portfolio?

The best answer is KISS - keep it simple stupid!

Starting a dividend portfolio with $1000 can be done with 10 stocks with an average of $100 invested in each. You might think it is not enough, but you can have a lot of variety in the size of the company and risk profile among 10 stocks. Also, there are 11 major sectors, so it means you come close to covering all corners of the stock market.

You only need to look at Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to see that the top 10 stocks make up the bulk of the money invested.

Keep in mind that $1000 is just your starting point. Adding to your portfolio with deposits and dividend reinvestments over time is a prerequisite for building long-term wealth. For commission-free investing in the UK, Europe and around the world, simply apply the sample principal but with a starting point of £1000.

An allocation of $100 per stock for the portfolio sounds simple enough, but what if one or more of the stocks you want to buy is priced over $100?
Using fractional shares for a small portfolio
Buying a suitable cross-section of large well-known stocks is a challenge for any beginner dividend portfolio. You might wish to invest in Apple shares, but how do you know which other stocks could fit alongside it and stay diversified?

Take Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway as an extreme example - at the time of writing, the stock price just ticked over $500,000. Just one of those shares, let alone nine others are too pricey for a beginner’s portfolio. Thanks to fractional shares, this is no longer a problem.

A fractional share is less than one whole share. Owning fractional shares allows you to buy less than one share of a company. Let’s say you have £10 to invest. How can you invest in Apple stock from the UK when each share is worth about $100? You can buy 0.1 ( a 1/10th fraction) of a share for $10 (which is worth a bit under £10).

To illustrate how fractional stocks can work for our theoretical $1000 portfolio, here's an example of five well-known stocks, including Apple (AAPL), for those thinking about an investment in Apple from the UK.
EXAMPLE
Apple - 1 Share = $165
Microsoft - 1 Share = $279
Visa - 1 Share = $211
McDonald’s - 1 Share = $252
Johnson & Johnson - 1 share = $181

Buying a single share of these 5 companies would cost $1088. By using fractional shares, you can reduce that to less than $500, leaving room for the next five shares in the 10-stock portfolio.

AAPL - 0.6 Shares = $99
MSFT - 0.2 Shares = $83.70
V - Shares = $105.50
MCD - 0.4 Shares = $100.80
JNJ - 0.5 shares = $90.50

Using fractional shares, the cost of this portfolio is now $479.50.
Using fractional shares, the cost of this portfolio is now $479.50. It has become possible to invest in Apple shares as well as these other big international companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, all for under $1000.

With the Trading 212 app, it is even easier than that. Instead of selecting the number of shares, you can just select the amount you want to invest, and the app automatically calculates how many fractions of shares that will be. With this approach, commission-free investing can be done from the UK when buying big stocks of big American companies.

Fractional shares help you to fit your desired portfolio within your budget and let you invest in more companies over a diverse range of countries, industries and trading instruments.
How To Balance Your Dividend Portfolio
Balance is important when investing. Making sure that your portfolio isn’t overly reliant on one particular stock or industry will make your portfolio durable.
Sectors
Spreading your risk over multiple sectors of the economy will ensure industry risk is reduced. This is a list of the 11 major economic sectors:
Information Technology
Health Care
Financials
Consumer Discretionary
Communication Services
Industrials
Consumer Staples
Energy
Utilities
Real Estate
Materials
Finding one company in each industry is the ideal way to protect a portfolio against adverse economic conditions. The logic is that when one sector may be struggling, another might be thriving.
Dividend yield
A simple way to diversify risk is to choose stocks with different size dividend yields. Yield correlates well to risk. That is because riskier companies generally have to offer higher yields to compensate investors for the higher risk than investing in ‘safer’ companies.

Flooding your portfolio with high-yield stocks means flooding it with risk. On the flip side, a portfolio of very low-yield stocks is going to have less-than-impressive returns.

One strategy is to have a base of lower yield stocks for safety, with a small allocation to some higher yield stocks for higher potential returns. Using the Trading 212 app, you can select the weight of each stock in your European or UK trading account by using Pies (more on this below).
Creating a dividend portfolio with ETFs
One way to supercharge the diversification of your beginner dividend portfolio is by adding an index ETF or an index fund.

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of stocks that trade on an exchange just as if it were a single stock. It’s a great way of investing in many different stocks at once with built-in diversification.

If you are mostly investing in American companies, you might opt for an ETF based on the S&P 500. If you’re investing in the UK it might be the FTSE 100, or in Europe the Euro Stoxx 600.
How to grow a dividend portfolio with Trading 212
To help your portfolio grow, you can reinvest the dividends received, giving you more stock from which to earn higher future payouts. As an example, there is a way to invest in Apple shares in the UK through the Trading 212 app, and reinvest dividends automatically even if your account is denominated in British pounds. This can be done using Pies and Autoinvest. You can buy AAPL stock as a percentage weighting in a Pie and automatically add funds to the Pie every month. Regular deposits into your portfolio are paramount, especially if you are investing for the long term. For your $1000 portfolio, adding $100 per month would be a great start if possible.
Recap
There are a few different ways that you can start a dividend portfolio. One way is to invest in 10 different stocks, which can be a mix of large and small companies. Another way is to invest in a balanced mix of stocks and ETFs. And yet another way is to invest in fractional shares of stocks.

No matter which method you choose, the important thing is to start investing in a way that best suits your needs and goals.

Investing in stocks to earn a return through dividends can be an excellent way to generate passive income and build wealth - and it requires relatively little upkeep.
Characteristics of a good dividend stock
You need to get familiar with the important characteristics that make a good dividend-paying stock. This is the kind of stock that you’d want to keep in your portfolio year after year. Specifically, these characteristics fit into two camps:

Qualitative - Looking at the business itself and what it does

Quantitative - Analysing the numbers
Big ideas
The qualitative features of a company are what it does, the industry it is in, how long it has existed etc. We give the example of Warren Buffett’s favourite Coca-Cola.
Quantitative measures such as the price-to-earnings ratio are formulas used to judge the size and health of a dividend.
Qualitative characteristics
The tactic of the stock brokers led by Leonardo Di Caprio in the Wolf of Wall Street was to first offer their clients a blue-chip stock to gain their trust before flipping them into pink sheets and penny stocks that earn very high commissions.

The first qualitative characteristic you should look for is that the company should not be the kind of “exciting opportunity” that stockbrokers would call you about! The company must be stable. If investors make money in exciting companies, it will be through the growth in the share price - not through dividends.

With a good dividend stock portfolio, you shouldn’t need to be constantly following the market with sophisticated techniques. You are a long-term passive shareholder directly benefiting from the profitability of a company. Dividend investors are generally looking to avoid risk and excessive stock price fluctuations so that they can comfortably grow their portfolio incrementally over time.

Understanding a company's stability and the industries, it operates in doesn’t have to take forever. A combination of research and common sense is needed. You need to get to know the company and what it does and decide whether it is a business that has good long-term prospects.

Warren Buffett’s stock with a good dividend
Warren Buffett has held shares of Coca-Cola since the late 1980s; the company accounts for about 8.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio at the time of writing.

Some Coca-Cola stats
79,000 employees - this is a huge company.
It’s in the consumer / non-cyclical sector - which is generally seen as defensive in a portfolio.
It’s in the beverage industry - which is a stable industry to be in, although not all beverage companies are stable.
Operates on all continents.
Owns major brands, Coca-Cola obviously, Sprite, Fanta but also Costa coffee, Vitamin Water, Minute Maid etc.
Operates in 200 countries.
To further your knowledge of a company, you can join the quarterly conference call that management holds after releasing quarterly earnings. Here you can hear the management discuss the company and hear analysts asking about what they think is currently important for the business.

It really doesn’t need to take more than a few hours to investigate a potentially good dividend stock to buy, which you might end up being invested in for years - even decades!
Quantitative characteristics
Here are 5 quantitative techniques to help decide what is a good dividend stock.

1. Dividend yield

This is probably the most basic technique for filtering your stock choices. The dividend yield is how much return in dividends you will get from your investment in a particular stock.
FORMULA
Dividend yield = (Dividend per share / Stock price) x 100
If the share price is $100, and it pays a dividend of $5 a year then the dividend yield is 5%.
WARNING
When dividend investing, one of the things to be avoided is what is called a "dividend trap" stock. These stocks pay a high dividend and look like great investments if you’re only looking at the dividend yield. That high dividend acts like blinkers over people's eyes - they see the big returns and miss some big underlying issues with the company.
As a general rule, It's not advisable to apply a single criterion. Try to include various techniques and give yourself the best chance at filtering out the bad stocks.

2. Dividend growth rate

Stable companies are to be cherished but one thing that should not be stable is the dividend payout. The best scenario is when companies raise it gradually over time. That way the investor earns more and has a better chance of keeping pace with inflation.

A company's history of past dividend payments is publicly available information and can easily be found online.

Past payouts are not a prediction of the future but a good dividend stock history does demonstrate that the company is capable of doing what you need it to do.

3. Payout ratio

Since investing is all about holding for the long term, you want to make sure the stock you choose can keep up its payments. One of the ways to do that is to check the payout ratio, which is what percentage of the company's profits are paid out in dividends.
FORMULA
Dividend payout ratio = Dividends paid / Net Income
A payout ratio in the 40-50% range means more than half of the company's profit is reinvested into growing the company.

Generally speaking, a lower payout ratio is more sustainable. It can also mean a lower dividend yield. This is a balance that you must strike when selecting your stocks.

4. Debt-to-profit

Another potential threat to the company’s stability is if it has a lot of debt. A company with too much debt may be forced to pay off debt instead of paying dividends.
FORMULA
Debt-to-profit = Total Debt / Annual Net Profit
The debt-to-profit ratio is often called "gearing". It can be seen in corporate reports expressed as debt-to-EBITDA. Generally, the lower the "gearing", the less risk the company carries.

Sometimes raising money through debt makes sense if, for example, it means taking advantage of low interest rates or increasing production capacity. Having debt isn't necessarily a bad thing; what matters is being able to pay off the debt, and the debt is being used to grow.

5. Price-earnings (P/E) ratio

If there’s one ratio people tend to know about, it's the P/E ratio, and for a good reason. This is the ratio between the price of the stock and its earnings.
FORMULA
PE ratio = Share price / Earnings per share (EPS)
High P/E ratios (over 20) typically mean a stock is overvalued, while low P/E ratios (closer to 10) mean a stock is probably undervalued.

Growth stocks tend to have high P/E ratios because they are not earning high profits. This is because the money earned is being reinvested to foster growth. Dividend investors are not looking for high-growth opportunities but rather companies with stable earnings.

When you’re planning to hold onto a stock for a long time, there’s no need to go bargain hunting, but you don’t want to buy a stock with a high valuation. By definition, the slower growth of a stable company does not justify a high P/E ratio, meaning the share price has a higher chance of falling below where you bought it.
Recap
There are a number of factors that can make a stock a good dividend stock. From a qualitative standpoint, the stock is typically a well-established company with a strong track record of profitability and a history of paying out regularly to shareholders. The company should also have a solid financial position, with a healthy balance sheet and consistent cash flow.

From a quantitative standpoint, a stock should have a high dividend yield (DY) and a low payout ratio. The DY is a measure of the annual payout as a percentage of the stock's current price, and the payout ratio is a measure of the company's dividend as a percentage of its earnings.

Dividend investing is a wealth-building strategy that all should at least consider – whether they are beginners or experienced investors.
Big ideas
Many companies payout dividends to distribute earnings to shareholders and encourage stock ownership.
Investors can use them for passive income and to grow wealth over the long term.
Dividend rates are per share and the dividend yield shows how much it is as a percentage of the share price.
What is a dividend?
A dividend is cash or sometimes shares that a company will pay to shareholders on a regular basis, just for owning the shares. Dividends exist so that companies can share profits among their owners. Investors can use them as a source of income or use the payout to buy more shares and increase the size of their investment.

What is a stock dividend?
A stock dividend is what a company will payout to shareholders who own the company’s stock.
A company will declare a dividend per share, so each share you own entitles you to a payout.
What is a dividend on a stock? The size of your payout is proportional to how many shares you own.
EXAMPLE
A shareholder with 100 shares will get 100x the dividend of a shareholder with 1 share.
A dividend payment from Trading 212
Every investor wants the best app for dividend investing. You needn’t look any further than Trading 212.

The money received as a dividend is sent to your Trading 212 account without you having to do anything. You will have made money by literally doing nothing. You don’t even need to sell any of your stocks!

Goal of dividend investing
The goal when investing in dividend stocks is not to find the next rocket ship stock headed for the moon! There are two main objectives:
Earning a passive income
Growing your wealth for the long term
The one you’re more focused on will often depend greatly on your age. Older investors that have retired or are close to retirement can use dividends as a source of income to replace the income earned by working. Younger investors who are working and don’t rely on other sources of income can reinvest the dividends to grow their wealth before they retire.

These goals can both be achieved by investing in strong, reliable companies that raise the amount they payout to shareholders as dividends over time.
Using dividends to earn income
Dividends are usually paid straight into the cash balance in your brokerage account. You can withdraw the cash as a source of income or use it to buy more shares. The strategy of using dividends as income is known as income investing. The goal is for the cash you receive to supplement and eventually replace your salary once you retire.
Building wealth with dividends
Instead of using the dividend payout as an income, you can reinvest it to buy more shares.

This creates a snowball effect - by owning more shares, you earn bigger dividends because they are paid per share, reinvesting those bigger payouts makes even bigger payouts. This process is known as compounding returns.

A comparison between the theoretical past earnings made when taking out the dividends versus reinvesting them can be seen in this chart of the S&P 500.

What’s really noticeable is how steeper the line gets. The line shows how much more you could make in later years because the impact of compounding grows over time. Like a snowball rolling down a hill.
Pros and cons of dividend investing
A good dividend stock investing strategy has many advantages and suits many types of investors, but there are some limitations, meaning it is not for everyone.

Pros
It is one of the simplest forms of passive income. If you compare buying a dividend stock to buying a rental property, there’s just no comparison in terms of simplicity.
You’re investing in larger, blue-chip companies, which generally have been in business for decades, making it one of the least risky forms of investing.
You can live off the income from your portfolio but it takes a lot of money and usually a lot of time to earn the money to do that.
Compounding returns means investing even a small amount of money could lead to big long-term gains.
Dividend payouts from top companies will tend to rise faster than general prices, offering you protection against inflation.
Cons
Not many ‘home runs’. The stock price of dividend-paying companies will often remain in the same price range for years. So again, this is not the way to go if you're after a quick buck.
If there is a downturn in the overall stock market, blue-chip stocks that pay dividends will usually go down less than the broader market, but they will most likely still go down, bringing your account balance down. Remember, any time you invest, your money is at risk.
Dividends aren’t guaranteed to stay the same. There is no obligation for a company to keep it, and when times are tough, companies will cut the dividend to save money and, in doing so, cut your source of passive income.
In dividend investing, there is a lot less ‘speculation’ than in other investments, like investing in growth stocks or day trading.

It’s critical to realise that this style of investing is not about trying to predict which way the stock price is going to go. The intention must be to find companies that are most likely to consistently payout to shareholders.
Where can I find dividend stocks?
A dividend stock is any stock you can purchase on public markets that pays out a regular dividend. There are different types, often categorised by how long the company has been paying out to shareholders. Companies that have paid out consistently for over 25 years are affectionately known as dividend aristocrats.

There’s nothing wrong with using pre-existing lists of the most popular stocks as a starting point. The best dividend investing books, such as Dividends don’t lie by Kelley Wright and Get Rich with Dividends by Marc Lichtenfeld, have many good suggestions.

AT&T is a good example of the kind of longevity you want to see in a dividend-paying company. It was founded in 1885 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, and it is still in business today! There is always a possibility that AT&T could go out of business after 137 years in the year you decide to invest, but it’s unlikely.

When investing in a stock, it is especially important to get familiar with the company that you’re investing in. The better you know a company, the more confidence you’ll have to hold onto the stock and reap the long-term rewards as a shareholder.
What is a dividend rate?
The dividend rate is the amount of currency a company will pay you per share you own. For example, Apple’s dividend rate in 2022 was $0.23.
EXAMPLE
You own 10,000 shares of Apple (AAPL) that pays out £0.23 per share per year.
10,000 x £0.23 = £2,300
What is a dividend yield?
Dividend yield is the amount you’ll get paid per year (dividend rate) as a percentage of your investment. As a dividend investor, this is probably the first statistic you will check for any new investment.

EXAMPLE
Let’s say you bought $1000 of AT&T stock and the dividend yield is 8.70%, you’ll make $87.00 in dividend income for the year. If you invest $100,000 – you’ll earn $8,700 instead.
Wrap
There are two key goals behind dividend investing: building wealth and generating passive income.

The goal of building wealth is to grow your nest egg so that you can eventually retire comfortably. To do this, you need to reinvest your dividends to purchase more shares of stock, which will increase in value over time.

The goal of generating passive income is to create a stream of income that does not require active work on your part. To do this, you need to invest in dividend-paying stocks that will provide you with a consistent income stream.

It is important to remember that dividend payments are not guaranteed. While most companies have a long history of dividend payments, there is always the potential for a cut. This could lead to a significant decline in income, which could make dividend investing a risky strategy for some investors.

Imagine having a clear understanding of ex-dividend dates and confidently navigating when and how different companies payout dividends.

Take the first step toward unlocking your investing potential by reading this article and gaining a comprehensive understanding of ex-dividend dates.
QUOTE
"The dividend is such an important factor in the success of many stocks that you could hardly go wrong by making an indiscriminate purchase of shares in companies that have a long record of dividend increases."
- Benjamin Graham

Big ideas
The ex-dividend date is the crucial cutoff point for determining whether shareholders are eligible to receive the upcoming dividend payment.
On the ex-dividend date, the stock price typically adjusts downward by the amount of the dividend.
"Dividend capture" strategies aim to buy shares just before the ex-dividend date and sell them shortly after.
Understanding ex-dividend: Definition and significance
The ex-dividend date is probably THE must-know date in dividend investing.
DEFINITION
The ex-dividend date is the cutoff point that determines whether an investor is eligible to receive a company's upcoming dividend payment. If you purchase shares on or after this date, it won’t be you who receives the dividend for that specific period but rather the investor that sold you the shares.
The purpose of the ex-dividend date is to ensure that the dividend payment goes to the rightful owner, the shareholder who held the stock before it went ex-dividend.

This date holds immense significance for investors seeking regular income from their investments. By understanding the ex-dividend date, investors can strategically time their stock purchases to maximise their dividend earnings. It is important to note that the ex-dividend date is just one of the key dates involved in the dividend payment process, along with the record date and payment date (we will discuss these momentarily).

On the ex-dividend date, an interesting phenomenon occurs in the stock market. The stock price typically adjusts downward by an amount approximately equal to the dividend being paid. This adjustment reflects the fact that new buyers of the stock will not receive the upcoming dividend, thus reducing the value of the stock. However, it's crucial to note that this adjustment merely reflects the dividend payment and does not represent a loss for the investor.

Understanding the ex-dividend date is not only beneficial for income-focused investors but also provides valuable insights into investor behaviour. Some investors may employ strategies known as "dividend capture" to use the ex-dividend date to their advantage.
How ex-dividend works: Basics and examples
To fully grasp the concept of ex-dividend, it's essential to understand how it works in practice. Let's delve into the basics of ex-dividend and explore some examples to gain a clearer understanding.

When a company declares a dividend, it sets specific key dates associated with the dividend payment. These dates include the declaration date, ex-dividend date, record date, and payment date.

The ex-dividend date is the one you need to hone in on to understand when you are (or are not) eligible to receive the dividend.

To illustrate this point, we can use a simplified example with Apple stock. Suppose Apple (AAPL) declares a dividend of $0.96 per share with an ex-dividend date of July 15th. If an investor buys Apple shares on July 14th, they are entitled to receive the dividend. However, if they purchase the shares on or after July 15th, they will not receive the dividend.

It's important to note that the ex-dividend date is determined by stock exchange rules and market conventions. While most countries follow the ex-dividend date conventions, specific rules may vary, especially when considering different markets like the UK or the US.
Key dates in the dividend process
To navigate the world of dividend investing effectively, it's crucial to understand the key dates involved in the dividend payment process.

Declaration date
When the company publicly announces the dividend payment and its amount. It provides investors with information regarding the upcoming dividend and allows them to plan their investment strategies accordingly.
Ex-dividend date
The line in the sand that separates when a stock begins trading without the entitlement to the forthcoming dividend payment. If you purchase the stock on or after the ex-dividend date, you will not receive the dividend. This date is usually set a few days before the record date to allow for transaction settlement.
Record date
This is when a company checks the latest shareholder records right before the dividend payment is due to determine who is officially eligible to receive it. It is only the shareholders ‘recorded’ on the books by the record date who get the dividend payment.
Payment date
One of the best dates in the calendar for shareholders is when the dividend is sent out by the company to all eligible shareholders. This is the date on which you can expect to receive the dividend in your brokerage account or through other means specified by the company.
Ex-dividend dates in the UK
For investors in the United Kingdom, it's important to understand the specific conventions and practices regarding ex-dividend dates.

In the UK, companies generally follow a three-day settlement period for stock trades. The ex-dividend date is typically set two business days (rather than one business day in many cases) before the record date. With modern technology, it's probably no longer necessary to be this long, but the original idea was to allow sufficient settlement time. Just make sure to check the specific ex-dividend dates for UK-listed companies to plan your investments accordingly.

The FTSE 100 Index, consisting of the 100 largest UK-listed companies, is a popular benchmark for many investors. Companies included in the FTSE 100 have different ex-dividend dates, so it's essential to make a note of relevant dates for each stock on the index that you own or plan to own.

Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange regularly make market announcements regarding dividends and ex-dividend dates, making it easy for you to plan your investments effectively.
What the ex-dividend date does to stock prices?
The ex-dividend date usually affects the stock price in quite a uniform manner each time, so it’s good to be aware of - especially to avoid any unnecessary misunderstanding over the causes of the resulting price moves.

On the ex-dividend date, the stock price - as a matter of market efficiency - adjusts to account for the upcoming dividend payment. This adjustment reflects the lower value of the shares that don’t contain an entitlement to receive the dividend. If you think about it, if the price didn’t drop, it would provide a perfect arbitrage opportunity (i.e. a risk-free return) to just buy the stock, get the dividend and sell the stock again.

As a result, the stock price tends to decrease by an amount roughly equal to the dividend being paid. This downward move in the price tends to show in bar and candlestick charts as a price gap (see below). This adjustment helps maintain the overall value of the stock.

Some investors may be attracted to stocks just before the ex-dividend date, aiming to capture the upcoming dividend payment (more on this below). As a result, the demand for the stock may increase, causing its price to rise leading up to the ex-dividend date.

Conversely, after the ex-dividend date, the stock may experience a decline in demand as investors primarily interested in the dividend exit their positions. This shift in investor behaviour can add to price fluctuations around ex-dividend dates.

As market participants quickly and efficiently incorporate new information, including the upcoming dividend payment, into stock prices, it ensures that investors are treated fairly and that stock prices accurately reflect the company's financial position.
NOTE
The overall value of the investment is usually not affected by the temporary decline in stock prices after the ex-div date. If you are focused on long-term growth and income, you should not be overly concerned about short-term price fluctuations around ex-dividend dates.
Trading strategies for ex-dividend dates
Investors can employ various strategies when buying and selling stocks in relation to ex-dividend dates. Understanding these strategies can help investors optimise their dividend income.
Buying before the ex-dividend Date
By buying before the ex-dividend date, investors can ensure they are entitled to receive the dividend. This can make sense for income-oriented investors looking to generate regular cash flow from their investments without needing to sell their holdings.
Selling after the ex-dividend date
Investors who are primarily interested in capital appreciation may consider selling their shares shortly after the ex-dividend date. By doing so, they can avoid potential price declines associated with the adjustment for the dividend payment.

However, it's important to carefully evaluate transaction costs and tax implications when executing this strategy.

Tax treatments depend on the individual circumstances of each person and might be subject to change in the future.
Dividend capture strategy
The dividend capture strategy involves buying shares just before the ex-dividend date and selling them shortly after, aiming to capture the dividend payment while minimising (or completely avoiding) the associated price decline.

This short-term trading strategy aims to generate income through dividend payments rather than seek long-term capital appreciation. Because of the need for market timing, it is better suited to active traders than to passive investors.
Long-term investment approach
For investors with a long-term investment horizon, the ex-dividend date has less significance. Instead of solely focusing on timing investments around ex-dividend dates, they prioritise the overall growth potential and stability of the company, as well as the sustainability of its dividend payments.

Taking a long-term approach takes away much of the source of stress associated with short-term price fluctuations around ex-dividend dates.
Advantages and disadvantages of buying before or after the ex-dividend date
Investors can employ various strategies when buying and selling stocks in relation to ex-dividend dates. Understanding these strategies can help investors optimise their dividend income:
Advantages of buying before the ex-dividend date
The most obvious advantage is that if you purchase shares before the ex-dividend date, you’re eligible to be paid the dividend.

Receiving the dividend in the upcoming payment cycle can result in a higher yield on your investment, especially for stocks with attractive dividend yields.

Income-focused investors get their desired cash flow to cover expenses and potentially increase their overall income.
Disadvantages of buying before the ex-dividend date
Stocks often experience a price adjustment on the ex-dividend date, reducing the stock price by an amount roughly equal to the dividend.

Timing the market to buy before the ex-dividend date can be challenging, as it requires accurate predictions and coordination of stock purchases.
Advantages of buying after the ex-dividend date
Buying after the ex-div date may provide an opportunity to purchase shares at a lower price, as the stock price typically adjusts downward on the ex-dividend date.

Reduced competition from investors primarily interested in capturing the dividend can create potential buying opportunities.
Disadvantages of buying after the ex-dividend date:
After the ex-dividend date, it means missing out on the upcoming dividend payment.

Possibly reduced near-term upside in the stock for investors purchasing after the ex-dividend date.
