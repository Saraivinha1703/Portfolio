I went to Berlim, Germany and work for a company called NinjaRMM, by the end of my internship it changed to NinjaOne. I worked for the marketing team collecting emails and phone numbers with webscrape and APIs. They needed a programmer because they had about 15 thousand leads to collect, which can not be done one by one. In the marketing workspace, they did not know much about programming so I had to choose the best way to solve their problem on my own.",
