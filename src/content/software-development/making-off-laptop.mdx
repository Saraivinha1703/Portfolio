# Making-off Laptop

The idea to make the laptop is just to show something related to software development, it is a very simple object, it does not have too many faces, vertexes or edges. Even the materials are simple although I tried to make them different than it looks, in the editor.

To make a custom object I’m using `@react-three/fiber`  which is a library to render for `three.js` . three.js is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to build, lights, shadows, meshes, everything that is basic that you would do directly if WebGL, three.js already have it.

Documentation for [`three.js`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and [fundamentals](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/fundamentals)

Documentation for [`@react-three/fiber`](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) 

My project is a Next.js 14 project and I’m going to make my object using Blender, so let’s start with that.

You can download Blender from their website, you can choose the [most recent version](https://www.blender.org/download/) or the [latest version](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/), 
I’m using version 2.9 for this project.

Once you open Blender, you can import an image to use as a base to help you make your object or follow a tutorial on youtube on how to make the object that you want. 

Once you have your model ready, with animations and the materials 
(or maybe not) you can export it as `.glb` file. Import the `.glb` file in [three.js editor](https://threejs.org/editor/) and see if everything is in the right place. 
If there is too many things wrong you might need to do some research about exporting custom models to `@react-three/fiber` .

If you have animations, test them to see if it works. If you do not have your materials applied to the object, 
that may happen because your materials are too complex, like a glass material, skin, materials with emission, and others. 
One way to solve this problem is to make a UV project of you model in Blender, bake the materials and save the files to use them as textures. 
This was a more complex approach that I did not take, I kept my object simple, just with colors and some animation.

If everything works in your model, export it from the editor and save it as a `.gltf` file into you public folder in your project. Make a component to render your model, like this:

```tsx
'use client';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { useLoader, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { 
    GLTFLoader 
} from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader';
import * as THREE from 'three'

export function LaptopModel() {
    const ref = useRef()

    const model = useLoader(GLTFLoader, "/3d-models/laptop.gltf")
    
    let mixer: THREE.AnimationMixer
    if (model.animations.length) {
        mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(model.scene);
        model.animations.forEach((clip: THREE.AnimationClip) => {
            const action = mixer.clipAction(clip)
            action.repetitions = 1
            action.clampWhenFinished = true
            action.play();
        });
    }

    useFrame((_, delta) => {
        mixer?.update(delta)
    })

    model.scene.traverse((child: { isMesh: any; castShadow: boolean; receiveShadow: boolean; material: { side: number; }; }) => {
        if (child.isMesh) {
            child.castShadow = true
            child.receiveShadow = true
            child.material.side = THREE.FrontSide
        }
    })

    return (
        <mesh 
            ref={ref} 
            position={[0, 1.3, 0]}
            rotation={[0.5, 0, 0]}
        >
            <primitive             
                object={model.scene}
                scale={1.4}
            />
        </mesh>
    )
}
```

In my case the animation was running at a infinity number of times, so I had to set the `action.clampWhenFinished` property to true, so the animation stops in the last frame when it ends. The `action.play()`  is the function that runs the animation. The rest if the code is basically the model setup and how it is displayed in the scene.

To end it I just added it to the Scene and also a purple light on top of it.
