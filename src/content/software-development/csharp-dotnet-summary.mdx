.NET is a C# framework, a development platform. It‚Äôs free, so Microsoft do not charge to develop using their framework, it‚Äôs open-source, meaning Microsoft‚Äôs .NET code is public for every developer that uses it to see, it is cross platform, which means it runs on Linux, macOS and Windows (those are the main OS used in the world) and it‚Äôs a development platform, because you can use it to develop in many different languages and different types of products and you also have a lot of libraries that will help you develop your system.

The modern .NET is the .NET Core, the first ‚Äúversion‚Äù of .NET was the .NET Framework, which is no longer developed. Here are some big differences between them.

| --- | --- |
| Runs o Linux, macOS and Windows | Only runs on Windows |
| Open-source and accepts contributions from community | Source code available but does not accept contributions |
| All the innovations are in .NET Core. It supports more applications types and delivers higher performance | Security and reliability bug fixes only |
| Not shipped with operating system | Included in Windows and updated by Windows updates |

If you want to use .NET Core download any SDK (Software Development Kit) above version 5 and if you want to work with .NET Framework (Recommend use it just for knowledge matter if you need to migrate to .NET Core) download any version from 4.8.1 below.
